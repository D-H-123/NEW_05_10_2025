2. Fill in expense details
3. In the category dropdown, your custom categories appear
4. Select your custom category

### In Subscriptions

## How Custom Categories Work

### Integration with Analysis

- Custom categories appear in all analysis charts and breakdowns
- They use your chosen colors in pie charts and bar graphs
- They're included in category spending summaries
- Works seamlessly with the existing analysis algorithms

### OCR Keyword Detection

When you scan a receipt:
1. The OCR engine extracts text from the receipt
2. The system searches for keywords from all categories (predefined + custom)
3. If a keyword match is found, that category is automatically selected
4. You can still manually change the category if needed

### Data Persistence

- All custom categories are stored locally using encrypted Hive database
- They're preserved across app restarts
- If you sign in with an account, you can sync them (if cloud sync is enabled)

## Examples

**Category Name:** Pet Care  
**Emoji:** üêï  
**Color:** Brown  
**Available In:** Receipt Scanning, Manual Expense  
**Keywords:** vet, veterinary, pet store, petco, petsmart, dog food, cat food, pet supplies

**Use Case:** When you scan a receipt from the vet or pet store, it automatically categorizes as "Pet Care"

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

- ‚úÖ Use clear, descriptive names
- ‚úÖ Keep names concise (2-3 words max)
- ‚úÖ Use consistent terminology
- ‚ùå Avoid very generic names like "Stuff" or "Things"
- ‚ùå Don't duplicate predefined category names

### Keyword Selection

- ‚úÖ Add specific merchant names (e.g., "petco", "petsmart")
- ‚úÖ Include common variations (e.g., "vet", "veterinary")
- ‚úÖ Use lowercase for keywords
- ‚úÖ Add 3-8 keywords per category
- ‚ùå Don't add too many generic keywords (reduces accuracy)

### Color Selection

- ‚úÖ Choose colors that visually differentiate from existing categories
- ‚úÖ Use color psychology (red for urgent, green for savings, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Group related categories with similar color shades

### Context Selection (Available In)

- Select **Receipt Scanning** if you'll scan receipts for this category
- Select **Manual Expense** if you'll manually enter these expenses
- Select **Subscription** if this category applies to recurring subscriptions
- **Pro Tip:** Select all three for maximum flexibility

## FAQ

### Q: How many custom categories can I create?
**A:** There's no hard limit, but we recommend keeping it under 20 for optimal UX.

### Q: Can I use the same name as a predefined category?
**A:** No, category names must be unique across both predefined and custom categories.

### Q: Will my custom categories sync across devices?
**A:** Currently, custom categories are stored locally. Cloud sync support may be added in future updates.

### Q: What happens to my expenses if I delete a custom category?
**A:** Existing expenses keep their category name but will display with default styling. The data is not lost.

### Q: Can I export my custom categories?
**A:** Not directly in the current version, but they're included in full app data backups.

### Q: Do keywords work with all languages?
**A:** Keywords work best with the language your OCR is configured for. Add keywords in the language of your receipts.

### Q: Can I have the same emoji for multiple categories?
**A:** Yes, emojis don't have to be unique, though unique emojis help with visual identification.

## Troubleshooting

### Custom category not appearing in dropdown
- Check that you selected the correct "Available In" options
- Restart the app to refresh the category cache
- Verify the category was saved successfully

### Keywords not working for OCR detection
- Ensure keywords are spelled correctly (matching the receipt text)
- Keywords are case-insensitive
- Try more specific keywords (brand names work better than generic terms)
- OCR detection happens before you can edit, so keyword matches appear immediately

### Category colors not showing correctly
- Colors are applied correctly in the app - check the analysis page for visual confirmation
- If colors look wrong, try editing the category and selecting a different color
