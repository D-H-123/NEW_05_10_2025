## 📋 Next Steps

### Step 1: Run Build Runner
Before you can use the new subscription feature, you need to generate the updated database adapter:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Step 2: Test It Out!
1. Open your app
2. Tap the **+ button** on the home page
3. Select **"Subscription"**
4. Fill out the form:
   - Title: "Netflix"
   - Amount: 9.99
   - Frequency: **Monthly**
   - Start Date: Today
   - Category: Entertainment
5. Save it!

### Step 3: See the Magic! ✨
- Go to your Bills page
- Look for your Netflix entry
- You'll see it has a **pink "Monthly" badge** in the top-right corner
- The card has a **pink border** to make it stand out
- It's easy to spot among your other receipts!

## 🔍 Visual Hierarchy

Your bills now have three distinct types:

1. **📷 Scanned Receipts** (from camera/gallery)
   - Regular white cards
   - No special badges
   - Show actual receipt image

2. **✏️ Manual Expenses** (manually entered)
   - Regular white cards  
   - No special badges
   - Show placeholder image

3. **🔄 Subscriptions** (recurring payments)
   - **Colored borders** (purple, pink, or blue)
   - **Frequency badges** (Weekly, Monthly, Yearly)
   - **Enhanced shadow** for extra visibility

## 💡 Tips

### For Better Organization:
- Use the **Source filter** to see only manual or scanned receipts
- Subscriptions will show up in both filters (they're a type of manual entry)
- Look for the badges to quickly identify subscription renewals

### For Tracking Renewals:
- Each subscription badge shows its frequency
- Purple badges (Weekly) renew every 7 days
- Pink badges (Monthly) renew every 30 days
- Blue badges (Yearly) renew every 365 days

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Will my existing subscriptions get badges?**  
A: No, only new subscriptions created after this update will have badges. Existing subscriptions were saved without the subscription type field.

**Q: Can I change a manual expense to a subscription?**  
A: Currently, you'd need to delete and recreate it as a subscription. A conversion feature could be added in the future.

**Q: Why don't scanned receipts have badges?**  
A: Scanned receipts are one-time purchases, not recurring subscriptions. Badges are only for recurring subscription payments.

**Q: Can I hide the badges?**  
A: The badges are designed to be helpful and non-intrusive. They only appear on actual subscriptions. If you find them too prominent, please provide feedback!

**Q: What if I want a different color?**  
A: The colors are carefully chosen to be distinct and attractive. If you need customization, you can edit the `subscription_badge.dart` file.
